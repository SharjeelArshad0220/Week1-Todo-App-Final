# 🚀 TaskMaster - Smart Todo List

**TaskMaster** is a logic-based Task Management application built to master **JavaScript Core Concepts** (DOM, Arrays, Objects). Unlike simple Todo lists, this app handles Data, Dates, and Priority Levels.

## 🌟 Features (Week 1 Complete)

* **Create Tasks:** Add tasks with a Title, Due Date, and Priority.
* **Priority Logic:** Tasks are automatically sorted into **High (Red)**, **Medium (Yellow)**, and **Low (Green)** categories.
* **CRUD Operations:**
    * **Create:** Push objects to array.
    * **Read:** Render UI dynamically using `forEach`.
    * **Update:** Toggle 'Done/Undo' status using `map`.
    * **Delete:** Remove tasks using `filter`.
* **Visual Feedback:** Tasks turn gray and strikethrough when completed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox for layout & Priority-based color themes.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):**
    * DOM Manipulation (`getElementById`, `createElement`)
    * Event Listeners
    * Array Methods (`push`, `map`, `filter`, `forEach`)
    * Conditional Logic (`if/else`, Ternary Operators)

## 🧠 What I Learned (Learning Outcomes)

Building this project helped me understand:
1.  **State Management:** How to keep the UI in sync with the Data (Array).
2.  **Array Iteration:** Why `map` is better for updating and `filter` is better for deleting.
3.  **DOM Rendering:** How to generate HTML dynamically from JavaScript objects.
4.  **Logic Building:** solving problems like "How to separate High priority tasks from Low priority ones?"

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Roadmap)

* [ ] **Local Storage:** Save data so it persists after refresh (Planned for Week 2).
* [ ] **Sorting:** Sort tasks by Date.
* [ ] **Edit Task:** Ability to edit a task after adding it.
